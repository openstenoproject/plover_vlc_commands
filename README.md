# Plover VLC commands

Add support for controlling VLC from Plover.


## Setup

* create `vlc.json` in the same directory as your configuration, set
  those settings that differ from defaults, e.g.:

    ``` json
    {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": "8080",
      "user": "",
      "pass": "password"
    }
    ```

* start VLC with the HTTP interface enabled, e.g.:
  `vlc --extraintf http --http-password password ...`


## Available commands

* `VLC_pause`, `VLC_resume`, `VLC_stop`, `VLC_toggle_pause`: self
  explanatory
* `VLC_rate`: change the rate of playback, for example
  `{PLOVER:VLC_rate:0.5}` to halve the playback speed, or
  `{PLOVER:VLC_rate:2.0}` to double it. Percentage and relative rate
  changes are also supported: `{PLOVER:VLC_rate:-10%}`.
* `VLC_seek`: seek the video, for example `{PLOVER:VLC_seek:-10s}` to
  seek backward 10 seconds, `{PLOVER:VLC_seek:+1m}` to seek forward 1
  minute, or `{PLOVER:VLC_seek:50%}` to seek to the halfway point.


## Timestamp support

A custom meta to get the current video timestamp is also provided:
`VLC_timestamp`. For example using `{[inaudible ^}{:VLC_timestamp}{^]}`
would translate to something like: `[inaudible 00:08:01]`.
